id=9|parent=8|type=auth|text=<i>So, that's how it is? Thanks very much,</i> you say, and leave.<br><br>The old woman yells something at your back.|location=courtyard
id=10|parent=8|type=user|text=Keep going.|location=courtyard
id=11|parent=10|type=auth|text=You walk on without looking around. You go out onto the street and walk on the sunny side. The spring sun is very pleasant. You walk on, squinting and smoking your pipe. On the corner of Sadovaya you happen upon Sakerdon Mikhailovich walking towards you.|location=street
id=12|parent=10|type=user|text=Stop and talk to Sakerdon Mikhailovich.|location=street
id=13|parent=10|type=user|text=Keep walking.|location=street
id=14|parent=12|type=auth|text=You greet each other, stop and talk for a long while.|location=street
id=14|parent=12|type=user|text=Stay and talk longer.|location=street
id=15|parent=12|type=user|text=Time to move along.|location=street
id=16|parent=14|type=auth|text=You get bored of standing out on the street and invite Sakerdon Mikhailovich into a cellar. You drink vodka, chasing it with hard-boiled eggs and sprats, then say your goodbyes, and you go on alone.<br><br>Then you suddenly remember that you've forgotten to turn off the electric stove at home.|location=street
id=18|parent=14|type=user|text=Go home to turn off the stove.|location=street
id=19|parent=14|type=user|text=Ignore it.|location=street
id=19|parent=18|type=auth|text=You're very upset. You turn around and walk home. The day began so well, and already the first bad turn. You should not have gone outside.|location=home
id=20|parent=18|type=user|text=Take a nap.|location=home
id=21|parent=20|type=auth|text=You come home, take off your jacket, take your watch out of your vest pocket and hang it up on the nail. Then you lock the door and lie down on the sofa. You'll lie here and try to fall asleep.<br><br>From the street you can hear the unpleasant screams of little boys. You lie there dreaming up tortures for them. |location=home
id=22|parent=20|type=user|text=Give them tetanus.|location=home
id=23|parent=22|type=auth|text=Most of all you like the idea of afflicting them with tetanus so that they'd suddenly stop moving. Their parents drag them back to their respective homes. They lie in their little beds and can't even eat, because their mouths don't open. They are nourished artificially. After a week the tetanus goes away, but the children are so weak that they still have to be confined to their beds for a whole month more. Then, bit by bit, they begin to recover.|location=home
id=24|parent=22|type=user|text=Finish them off.|location=home
id=25|parent=24|type=auth|text=You afflict them with a second bout of tetanus and they all expire.<br><br>You lie on the sofa with your eyes open and can't fall asleep. You recall the old woman with the clock that you saw today in the yard, and it pleases you that her clock had no hands. Just the other day at the pawn shop you saw the most hideous kitchen clock and the hands were made in the form of a knife and a fork.<br><br>My God! but you haven't yet turned off the electric stove! You jump up and turn it off, then lie down again on the sofa and try to fall asleep. You close my eyes. You're not sleepy. In the window the spring sun shines right down on you. You get hot. You get up and sit down in the armchair by the window.|location=home
id=26|parent=24|type=user|text=Try to fall asleep.|location=home
id=28|parent=24|type=user|text=Give up on the nap.|location=home
id=29|parent=28|type=auth|text=Now you're sleepy, but you will not sleep. You will take paper and pen and you will write. You sense an awful strength within you. You thought everything over yesterday already. It will be a story about a miracle worker who lives in your time and does not work miracles. He knows he is a miracle worker and could create any sort of miracle, but he does not do it. He is evicted from his apartment. He knows that were he to just wave a finger the apartment would stay his, but he does not do it; he timidly vacates his apartment and lives outside of town in a shed. He can turn this old shed into a wonderful brick house, but he does not do it; he continues to live in the shed and in the end he dies, not having worked a single miracle in all his life.|location=home
id=30|parent=28|type=user|text=Write the story.|location=home
id=31|parent=30|type=auth|text=You sit and wring your hands with joy. Sakerdon Mikhailovich will explode with envy. He thinks that you're no longer capable of writing a thing of genius. Quickly, quickly, to work! Away with any sleep and laziness! You will write for eighteen hours straight!|location=home
id=32|parent=30|type=user|text=Write for eighteen hours straight.|location=home
id=33|parent=30|type=user|text=Get your writing supplies.|location=home
id=34|parent=33|type=auth|text=You shiver all over with anticipation. You can't figure out what you should do: you needed to take pen and paper, but you grabbed various objects, not at all the ones that you needed. You ran about the room from the window to the desk, from the desk to the stove, from the stove to the desk again, and then to the couch and again to the window. You couldnt breathe from the fire that raged in your chest. It's only five o'clock yet. The whole day is ahead, and the evening, and all of the night.|location=home
id=35|parent=33|type=user|text=Forget the supplies and get started.|location=home
id=36|parent=35|type=auth|text=You stand in the middle of the room. What am you thinking? It's already twenty past five. You have to write. You push the little table up to the window and sit down at it. In front of you is the graph paper; in your hand, the pen.<br><br>Your heart is still pounding too hard and your hand shakes. You wait to settle down. You put down the pen and fill your pipe. The sun is shining right in your eyes; you squint and light your pipe.<br><br>Now a crow flies past the window. You look out the window and see a man on the sidewalk with a mechanical leg. He’s knocking loudly with his leg and his cane.<br><br><i>So…</i> you say to yourself as you continue looking out the window.<br><br>The sun hides behind the chimney of the apartment house standing opposite. The shadow cast by the chimney runs along the roof then flies across the street and falls across your face. You ought to take advantage of this shadow and write a few words about the miracle worker. You grab the pen and write: <i>The miracle worker was tall.</i>|location=home
id=38|parent=35|type=user|text=Give up.|location=home
id=39|parent=38|type=auth|text=You can't write anything more. You sit until the moment you start experiencing hunger. Then you stand up and go over to the small cupboard where your provisions are kept. You feel around in there but find nothing. A cube of sugar and nothing more.<br><br>Someone's knocking at the door.|location=home
id=39|parent=38|type=user|text=Ask who it is.|location=home
id=40|parent=38|type=user|text=Ignore it.|location=home
id=41|parent=39|type=auth|text=<i>Who is it?</i><br><br>No one answers you. You open the door and before you you see the old woman who this morning was standing in the courtyard with the clock. You're very surprised and can't say a thing.<br><br><i>And here you are,</i> says the old woman and walks into your room.<br><br>You stand at the door and don’t know what to do—boot her out or, on the contrary, offer her a seat? But the old woman walks over to your armchair by the window and sits down herself.<br><br><i>Close the door, and lock it,</i> the old woman tells you.|location=home
id=41|parent=39|type=user|text=Close the door and lock it.|location=home
id=42|parent=39|type=user|text=Boot her out.|location=home
id=43|parent=41|type=auth|text=You close and lock the door.<br><br><i>Get down on your knees,</i> says the old woman.|location=home
id=43|parent=41|type=user|text=Get down on your knees.|location=home
id=45|parent=43|type=auth|text=And you get down on your knees.<br><br>But here you begin to understand the complete awkwardness of your situation. Why are you standing on your knees before some old woman? And why is this old woman in your room sitting in your favorite chair? Why did you not throw this old woman out?|location=home
id=46|parent=43|type=user|text=Tell her to leave.|location=home
id=48|parent=46|type=auth|text=<i>Listen up,</i> you say, <i>what right do you have giving orders in my room, and moreover ordering me around? I have no desire to stand on my knees.</i><br><br><i>And you don't have to,</i> says the old woman. <i>Now you must lie down on your stomach and stick your face in the floor.</i>|location=home
id=49|parent=46|type=user|text=Lie down on your stomach and stick your face in the floor.|location=home
id=51|parent=49|type=auth|text=You instantly fulfill her command.<br><br>Directly in front of you you see precisely drafted squares. Pain in your shoulder and in your right hip forces you to change your position. You was lying face down; now with great difficulty you get up onto your knees. All your members had fallen asleep; they bend poorly. You look around and see yourself in your room standing on your knees in the middle of the floor. Consciousness and memory slowly come back to you. You look around the room again and see that on the chair by the window someone is sitting. It's not very light in the room, probably because it's white nights. Your gaze is fixed. Oh God! Can it really be the old woman sitting in your armchair still? You crane your neck and look. Yes, of course, it's the old woman, and she's dropped her head onto her chest. She must have fallen asleep. You get up and, limping, approach her. The old woman's head droops on her chest, her arms hang by the sides of the chair. You want to grab this old woman and push her out the door.|location=home
id=52|parent=49|type=user|text=Wake her up and make her leave.|location=home
id=53|parent=49|type=user|text=Let her sleep.|location=home
id=54|parent=52|type=auth|text=<i>Listen to me,</i> you say, <i>You are in my room. I need to work. I'm asking you to leave.</i><br><br>The old woman doesn't budge. You bend down and peer into the old woman's face. Her mouth is slightly open and jutting out of her mouth are the false teeth that must have come loose. And suddenly everything becomes clear to you: The old woman is dead.<br><br>A terrible feeling of irritation overtakes you. What for did the old woman die in your room? You can't stand dead people. And now fuss over this carrion, go talk to the janitor and the building super and explain to them why this old woman turned up at your place. You look at the old woman with loathing. But what if, maybe, she's not dead? You feel her forehead. It's cold. Her hand also. Well, what are you to do?|location=home
id=55|parent=52|type=user|text=Go talk to the super.|location=home
id=56|parent=52|type=user|text=Have a smoke.|location=home
id=57|parent=56|type=auth|text=You light up your pipe and sit down on the sofa. A mad anger swells up inside you.<br><br><i>What a scumbag!</i> you say out loud.<br><br>The dead old woman sits like a sack in your armchair. The teeth jut out of her mouth. She resembles a dead horse.|location=home
id=58|parent=56|type=user|text=Cover her with a newspaper.|location=home
id=60|parent=58|type=auth|text=<i>A disgusting scene,</i> you say, but you can't cover the old woman with a newspaper because who knows what might happen under a newspaper.<br><br>Behind the wall you can hear movement: That's your neighbor getting up, a train engine driver. That's just what you need, for him to sniff out that you've got a dead old woman sitting in your room! You listen closely to the steps of your neighbor. What's taking him so long? It's already half past five! It's long time for him to be going. Oh my God! He's fixing to have tea! You can hear the primus stove making noise behind the wall. Ack, if that cursed engine driver would just hurry up and leave!<br><br>You pull your legs up onto the sofa and lie there. Eight minutes go by, but the neighbor's tea still isn't ready and the primus stove is hissing.|location=home
id=62|parent=58|type=user|text=Take a nap.|location=home
id=63|parent=62|type=auth|text=You close your eyes and nap.<br><br>You dream that your neighbor has gone and you go out, at the same time as he, onto the landing and slam the door with the spring lock behind you. You don't have a key and you can't get back into the apartment. You have to buzz and wake the rest of the tenants, and that's real bad. You stand on the landing thinking what you should do, and suddenly you notice that you have no hands. You tilt your head to get a better look if you have hands or not, and you see that on one side instead of a hand a table knife juts out, and on the other side, a fork.<br><br><i>There now,</i> you say to Sakerdon Mikhailovich, who's sitting for some reason right nearby on a folding chair. <i>You see,</i> you say to him, <i>what kind of hands I've got.</i><br><br>But Sakerdon Mikhailovich sits silently, and you realize that it's not the real Sakerdon Mikhailovich, but a clay one.<br><br>Then you wake up and it dawns on you that you're lying in your room on the sofa and that at the window in the armchair is the dead old woman.<br><br>You quickly turn your head towards her. The old woman is not in the armchair. You gaze at the empty armchair and you are filled with wild joy. That means it was all a dream. Only, where did it begin? Did the old woman come into your room yesterday evening? Perhaps that was also a dream? You came back home yesterday because I'd forgotten to turn off the electric stove. But maybe that was also a dream? Either way, how great is it that there is no dead old woman in your room and you don't have to go to the building super and fuss with the corpse!<br><br>But wait, how long have you been asleep? You looked at the clock. Half past nine, must be morning.<br><br>God! What doesn't happen in dreams!|location=home
id=63|parent=62|type=user|text=Get up.|location=home
id=65|parent=63|type=auth|text=You dropped your feet down off the sofa about to stand up, when suddenly you saw the dead old woman lying on the floor behind the table by the chair. She was lying there face up and the dentures that had fallen out of her mouth bit into her nostril with one tooth. The arms were turned under the torso and were not visible, and bony legs in white, dirty wool stockings stuck out from under her hiked-up skirt.|location=home
id=68|parent=63|type=|text=Go talk to the super.|location=home
id=66|parent=63|type=user|text=Kick the old lady.|location=home
id=67|parent=66|type=auth|text=<i>Scumbag!</i> you yelled and, running up to the old woman, kicked her in the chin with your boot.<br><br>Her dentures flew off into the corner. You wanted to hit the old woman a second time, but hesitated to leave marks on the body, or else they'd later decide that it was you who killed her.<br><br>You backed away from the old woman, sat down on the sofa and lit up your pipe. About twenty minutes passed like that. Now it was clear to you that no matter what, the case would be transferred to criminal investigation and the pea brain detective would charge you with murder. The situation was turning out to be serious, and then there was the boot to the chin on top of it all.<br><br>You walked up to the old woman again, bent down and started examining her face. There was a small dark spot on the chin. No, they couldn't raise a stink about that. So what? Maybe the old woman banged herself on something or other while she was still alive? You calm down a little and start to pace the room, smoking your pipe and mulling over your situation.<br><br>You're walking around and around the room, and you start feeling your hunger more and more. You even start shivering from hunger. Again you fumble around in the little cupboard where your provisions are kept, but find nothing except for the piece of sugar.|location=home
id=69|parent=66|type=user|text=Go out and buy some food.|location=home
id=70|parent=66|type=user|text=Go tell someone about the corpse.|location=home
id=71|parent=69|type=auth|text=You take out your wallet and count the money. Eleven rubles. That means you can buy yourself some ham and bread and there'll still be some left over for tobacco.<br><br>You straighten your tie which had gotten beaten out of shape over the course of the night. You take your watch, put on your jacket, walk out into the hall, thoroughly lock the door to your room, put the key in your pocket and walk outside. First you must eat, then your thoughts will be clearer and you will undertake some kind of action with this carrion.<br><br>On the way to the store you get this idea: Why not drop in on Sakerdon Mikhailovich and tell him everything, maybe together we can come up with something sooner. But right away you reject this idea because some things must be done alone, without witnesses.<br><br>There was no ham at the store so you bought yourself half a kilogram of sausage links. There was no tobacco either. From the store you went straight to the bakery.<br><br>At the bakery there was a big crowd and a long line formed for the cashier. You made a face but got in line anyway. The line moved very slowly and then stopped completely because some sort of scene had occurred at the cash register.<br><br>You made a face as though you knew nothing about it and gazed into the back of a young little lady who was standing in line ahead of you. The young little lady was obviously very curious: She craned her little neck right and left and once a minute she would get up on her tippy-toes to get a better look at what was going on at the register. Finally she turned to you and asked,<br><br><i>Do you know what's going on over there?</i>|location=bakery
id=71|parent=69|type=user|text=No.|location=bakery
id=72|parent=71|type=auth|text=<i>Sorry, I don't,</i> you said as dryly as possible.<br><br>The little lady spun around in all directions and finally again addressed you.<br><br><i>Do you think you could go and find out what's going on over there?</i>|location=bakery
id=73|parent=71|type=user|text=No.|location=bakery
id=74|parent=73|type=auth|text=<i>I'm sorry, I'm not in the least interested,</i> you said, even more dryly.<br><br><i>It doesn't interest you?</i> exclaimed the little lady. <i>But you're being held up in the line because of it too.</i>|location=bakery
id=75|parent=73|type=user|text=Don't respond.|location=bakery
id=76|parent=75|type=auth|text=You did not reply and only bowed slightly. The little lady looked you over carefully.<br><br><i>Of course it's not a man's business to stand in line for bread,</i> she said. <i>I feel bad for you, you have to stand here. You must be a bachelor?</i>|location=bakery
id=77|parent=75|type=user|text=Yes.|location=bakery
id=78|parent=77|type=auth|text=<i>Yes, I'm a bachelor!</i> you replied, a bit confused, but continuing by inertia to answer rather dryly and with that bowing slightly.<br><br>Once more the little lady looked you over from head to toe and suddenly, stretching her finger out toward your sleeve, said, <i>How about I buy what you need and you wait for me outside.</i>|location=bakery
id=79|parent=77|type=user|text=No.|location=bakery
id=80|parent=79|type=auth|text=You were at a complete loss.<br><br><i>I'm grateful to you,</i> you said. <i>It's very kind of you, but, really, I could do it myself.</i><br><br><i>No, no,</i> said the little lady, <i>go on outside. What were you going to buy?</i>|location=bakery
id=81|parent=79|type=user|text=Tell her what to buy.|location=bakery
id=82|parent=81|type=auth|text=<i>I see,</i> you said, <i>I was going to buy half a kilo of black bread, but only the form-baked loaf, the one that's cheaper. I like it better.</i><br><br><i>Well, there now, that's good,</i> said the little lady. <i>And now on your way. I'll buy it and we'll settle up after.</i><br><br>And she even pushed you a little under the elbow.<br><br>You walk out of the bakery and stand right by the door. The spring sun shines right in your face. You light up your pipe. What a kind little lady! It's so rare nowadays. You stand there squinting from the sunlight, smoking your pipe, and think about the kind little lady. She does have light brown eyes. Simply marvelous how nice looking she is!|location=street
id=83|parent=81|type=user|text=Have a smoke.|location=street
id=84|parent=83|type=auth|text=<i>You smoke a pipe?</i> you hear a voice near you. The kind little lady extends the bread to you.<br><br><i>Oh, I'm eternally grateful to you,</i> you say, taking the bread.<br><br><i>And you smoke a pipe! You like that terribly,</i> says the kind little lady.<br><br>And between you occurs the following conversation.<br><br>SHE: I take it you go for bread yourself?|location=street
id=85|parent=83|type=user|text=Yes.|location=street
id=85|parent=85|type=auth|text=YOU: Not only for bread; I buy everything for myself.<br><br>SHE: And where do you dine?|location=street
id=86|parent=85|type=user|text=At home.|location=street
id=87|parent=86|type=auth|text=YOU: Ordinarily I cook dinner for myself. And sometimes I eat at the pub.<br><br>SHE: You like beer?|location=street

id=93|parent=92|type=auth|text=YOU: I'm sorry, but can you ask you about one thing?<br><br>SHE (blushing heavily): Of course, ask away.|location=street

id=94|parent=93|type=auth|text=YOU: Alright, I'll ask you. Do you believe in God?<br><br>SHE (surprised): In God? Yes, of course.|location=street

id=96|parent=93|type=user|text=Go to her apartment.|location=street
id=97|parent=95|type=auth|text=YOU: And what would you say if we were to buy some vodka now and go to my place. I live not far from here.<br><br>SHE (keenly): Well then, I accept.<br><br>YOU: Then let's go.<br><br>You walk into a store and you buy half a liter of vodka. You don't have any more money, only some measly change. You're talking about different things all the time, and you suddenly remember that in your room, on the floor, is a dead old woman.|location=street
id=98|parent=95|type=user|text=Leave.|location=street
id=99|parent=98|type=auth|text=You look back at your new acquaintance. She's standing at a counter and looking at jars of jam. You carefully make your way to the door and exit the store. Just then there's a tram stopping right across from the store. You jump into the tram, not even looking at the number.|location=street
id=100|parent=98|type=user|text=Go home.|location=street
id=101|parent=98|type=user|text=Go to Sakerdon Mikhailovich's.|location=street
id=102|parent=101|type=auth|text=You get off at Mikhailovskaya Street and walk to Sakerdon Mikhailovich's. In your hand a bottle of vodka, sausage links and bread.<br><br>Sakerdon Mikhailovich himself opened the doors for you. He was in a robe thrown over his bare body, in Russian boots with the tops cut off and a fur hat with ear flaps, but the earflaps were pulled up and tied in a bow on top.<br><br><i>A pleasure,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich, seeing you there.<br><br><i>Have I torn you away from your work?</i> you asked.<br><br><i>No, no,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich. <i>I wasn't doing anything, just sitting on the floor.</i><br><br><i>I see,</i> you said to Sakerdon Mikhailovich, <i>I've come to you with vodka and chasers. If you have nothing against it, let's have a drink.</i><br><br><i>Very good,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich. <i>You should come in.</i><br><br>You walked through to his room. You uncorked the bottle of vodka and Sakerdon Mikhailovich placed two shot glasses on the table and a plate of boiled meat.<br><br><i>I've got some sausage links here,</i> said I. <i>So how are we going to eat them, raw, or should we boil them?</i><br><br><i>We'll put them on to boil,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich, <i>and while they're boiling, we'll drink the vodka with boiled meat. It's from a soup, excellent boiled meat!</i><br><br>Sakerdon Mikhailovich placed a small pot on the kerosene stove, and we sat down to drink vodka.<br><br><i>Drinking vodka is healthy,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich, filling the glasses. <i>Mechnikov wrote that vodka is healthier than bread and bread is just straw that rots in our stomachs.</i><br><br><i>Your health!</i> you said, clinking glasses with Sakerdon Mikhailovich.<br><br>We drank and chased it down with boiled meat.<br><br><i>Tastes good,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich. But at that moment something made an abrupt cracking noise in the room.<br><br><i>What's that?</i> you asked.<br><br>We sat silently and listened. Suddenly it cracked once more. Sakerdon Mikhailovich jumped out of his chair and, running up to the window, tore down the curtain.<br><br><i>What are you doing,</i> you screamed.<br><br>But, without a reply, Sakerdon Mikhailovich threw himself toward the kerosene stove, grabbed the pot with the curtain and placed it on the floor.<br><br><i>Damn it!</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich. <i>I forgot to pour water in the pot, and the pot's enamel, and now the enamel's popped off.</i><br><br><i>Now I get it,</i> you said, nodding your head.<br><br>You sat down to the table again.<br><br><i>Damn them,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich, <i>we'll eat the sausages raw.</i>|location=sakerdon

It is impolite to ask a man to loan you fifty rubles if you saw that he just put two hundred in his pocket. It's his business whether to give you the money or to decline, and the most convenient and pleasant way to decline is to lie that you have none. You've seen that this man has the money and thereby you have stripped him of the opportunity to simply and pleasantly decline. You have stripped him of his right to choose, and that's rotten. It is an impolite and tactless act. And to ask a person 'Do you believe in God?' is also an impolite and tactless act.</i><br><br><i>Well,</i> you said, <i>there's no comparison.</i><br><br><i>And I'm not comparing,</i> said Sakerdon Mikhailovich.<br><br><i>Well alright,</i> you said, <i>let's drop it.

Sakerdon Mikhailovich laid his hands behind his back where they were not to be seen. And from underneath his hiked-up robe protruded bare bony legs shod in Russian boots with their tops cut off.<br><br>You walked down Nevsky submerged in your thoughts. You should go right away to the building super and tell him everything. And after you've finished with the old woman you will stand by the bakery day in and day out until you see that nice little lady. After all, you owe her 48 kopeks for the bread. You have an excellent excuse to search for her. The vodka was still having its effect and it seemed that everything was coming together nice and easy.<br><br>On the Fontanka you approached a kiosk and with the leftover change you drank a large mug of bread beer. The bread beer was bad and sour, and you walked on with a vile taste in your mouth.<br><br>On the corner of Liteinaya some drunk staggered and pushed you. It's a good thing that you don't have a revolver. You would have killed him right on the spot.<br><br>You must have walked all the way home with an angry scowl on your face. In any case, almost everyone you passed turned to look at you.|location=street
id=127|parent=124|type=user|text=Go talk to the super.|location=street
id=129|parent=127|type=auth|text=You walked into the building super's office. On the desk sat a squat, dirty, pugnosed, crosseyed and fairheaded girl, rubbing her lips with rouge and gazing into a compact mirror.<br><br><i>And where's the super?</i> you asked.<br><br>The girl was silent, still rubbing her lips.<br><br><i>Where's the super?</i> you repeated in a sharp voice.<br><br><i>Tomorrow, not today,</i> answered the dirty, pugnosed, crosseyed and fairheaded girl.|location=street
id=130|parent=127|type=user|text=Go home.|location=street
id=131|parent=130|type=auth|text=You walked out onto the street. On the opposite side walked a cripple on a mechanical leg knocking loudly with his leg and his stick. Six little boys ran after the cripple, mocking his gait.<br><br>You turned into your vestibule and started climbing the stairs. On the second floor you stopped. A disgusting thought went through your head. The old woman must have begun to decompose. You hadn't closed the windows and they say that with open windows dead people decompose more quickly. Utter stupidity! And that damned super won't be in till tomorrow! You stood there several minutes in indecision and climbed onward.<br><br>You stopped again at the door to your apartment. Maybe you should go down to the bakery and wait for that sweet little lady? You would plead with her to let you stay at her place for two or three nights. But then you remember that she's already bought bread today, and that means she won't be going to the bakery. And, anyway, nothing would come of it.<br><br>You unlocked the door and walked into the hallway. At the end of the hallway a light was on and Marya Vasilyevna, holding some sort of rag in her hand, was rubbing it with another rag. Seeing you, Marya Vasilyevna shouted,<br><br><i>An owd man was wooking fow you!</i><br><br><i>What old man?</i><br><br><i>I dunno,</i> Marya Vasilyevna answered.<br><br><i>When was it?</i> you asked.<br><br><i>Awso dunno,</i> said Marya Vasilyevna.<br><br><i>Was it you who talked to the old man?</i> you asked Marya Vasilyevna.<br><br><i>I,</i> answered Marya Vasilyevna.<br><br><i>So how is it that you don't know when?</i> you said.<br><br><i>Two hows o' so ago,</i> said Marya Vasilyevna.<br><br><i>And what did this old man look like?</i> you asked.<br><br><i>Awso dunno,</i> said Marya Vasilyevna and went away into the kitchen.|location=hallway
id=132|parent=130|type=user|text=Go to the apartment.|location=hallway
id=50|parent=132|type=auth|text=You went to your room.<br><br><i>And what if,</i> you thought, <i>the old woman's vanished? I'll walk into the room and the old woman's gone. God! Are there really no miracles?</i><br><br>You unlocked the door and slowly pushed it ajar. Maybe you only imagined it, but the sickeningly sweet smell of decay wafted in your face. You peeked around the slightly opened door and for a moment was frozen to the spot. The old woman was on all fours slowly crawling toward you.<br><br>With a shout you slammed the door, turned the key and jumped back against the wall opposite the door.<br><br>Marya Vasilyevna appeared in the hallway.<br><br><i>D'you caw fow me?</i> she asked.<br><br>You was shaking so bad that you couldn't answer and only shook your head no. Marya Vasilyevna came closer.<br><br><i>You wuh tawking to someone,</i> she said.<br><br>Again you shook your head no.<br><br><i>Cwazy,</i> said Marya Vasilyevna and walked back into the kitchen, looking back at you several times on her way.<br><br><i>Can't stand here like this. Can't stand here like this,</i> you repeated in your thoughts. The phrase came together somewhere inside you. You chanted it until it made it all the way to your consciousness.<br><br><i>Yes, I can't stand here like this,</i> you said to yourself, but continued standing there like you were paralyzed. Something awful had happened, but ahead of you there was something that had to be done that was perhaps even more awful than what had already happened. A whirlwind spun your thoughts around in circles and you could see only the wrathful eyes of the dead old woman as she slowly crawled toward you on all fours.|location=hallway
id=59|parent=132|type=user|text=Find a weapon.|location=hallway
id=133|parent=59|type=auth|text=Burst into the room and shatter the old woman's skull. That's what must be done! You even searched around with your eyes and were content upon noticing a croquet mallet that had for no known reason and for many years been standing in the corner of the hallway. Grab the mallet, burst into the room, and slam..!<br><br>The shivers had not yet passed. You stood with shoulders raised from the inner chill. your thoughts raced, got tangled, and returned to their starting point, then raced again, gaining new ground, while you stood listening intently to your thoughts and was as if standing apart from them, as if you were not their captain.<br><br><i>Dead people,</i> your own thoughts were explaining to you, <i>are a no good lot. It's wrong to call them deceased, because they are, rather, un-deceased. They have to be watched, and carefully. Ask any watchman at the mortuary. Why do you think he's been posted there? For one thing only. To keep watch so that the dead people don't crawl away. There have been, in this regard, some curious cases. One dead man, while the watchman was at the public baths on executive orders, crawled out of the mortuary and into the disinfection chamber, and there he ate a bunch of linens. The sanitation crew gave him an excellent thrashing, but they had to pay for the ruined linen out of their own pockets. And another dead man crawled into the maternity ward and scared everyone to the point that one of the mothers-to-be manufactured a premature miscarriage and the dead man threw himself onto the ejected fetus and, chewing loudly, set to consuming it. And when one nurse struck the dead man on the back with a wooden stool he bit the brave nurse in the leg and she was infected with corpse poison and died soon thereafter. So, dead people, a no good lot. You can't let down your guard.</i><br><br><i>Stop!</i> you said to your own thoughts. <i>You are talking nonsense! Dead people are immobile!</i><br><br><i>Alright,</i> your own thoughts said to you, <i>then go in your room, where there is, as you say, an immobile dead person.</i>|location=hallway

id=135|parent=134|type=auth|text=A surprising stubbornness spoke up inside you.<br><br><i>I will!</i> you said with confidence to your own thoughts.<br><br><i>Try it!</i> your own thoughts mocked you.<br><br>This mockery infuriated you once and for all. You grabbed the croquet mallet and rushed to the door.<br><br><i>Wait!</i> your own thoughts shouted to you. But you had already turned the key and thrown the door wide open.<br><br>The old woman lay by the threshold with her face to the floor.<br><br>With the croquet mallet raised, you stood at the ready. The old woman didn't budge.<br><br>Your shivers subsided, and your thoughts flowed bright and clear. You were the captain of them.|location=home

id=137|parent=136|type=auth|text=<i>First things first: Close the door!</i> you commanded yourself.<br><br>You took the key out of the outer side of the door and inserted it on the inside. You did this with your left hand while in your right you held the croquet mallet and did not let the old woman out of your sight the whole time. You locked the door and, cautiously stepping over the old woman, walked out into the middle of the room.|location=home
id=138|parent=136|type=user|text=Hide the body.|location=home
id=139|parent=138|type=auth|text=<i>Now I'm going to get even with you,</i> you said. You had come up with a plan, the kind that murderers in crime novels and newspaper stories regularly resort to: you wanted simply to hide the old woman in a suitcase, take her outside the city and dump her in a swamp. You knew one such place.<br><br>The suitcase was under the sofa. You dragged it out and opened it. In it were various odd items: several books, an old felt hat, and torn linens. You laid all this out on the sofa.<br><br>At that moment the apartment door slammed and it seemed to you that the old woman shuddered.|location=home
id=140|parent=138|type=user|text=Get the mallet.|location=home
id=141|parent=140|type=auth|text=Momentarily you jumped up and grabbed the croquet mallet.<br><br>The old woman is lying still. You stand there listening. It's the engine driver come back; you hear him walking in his room. Now he's walking down the corridor into the kitchen.

id=142|parent=140|type=user|text=Go out in the hallway and try to act normal.|location=home
id=143|parent=142|type=auth|text=Damn it all! You should walk down the hallway and calm them with your appearance.<br><br>Again you stepped over the old woman. You set the mallet down right by the door so that upon your return without even entering the room you could have the mallet in your hands, and you walked out into the hallway. Voices carried from the kitchen, but you couldn't make out the words. You closed the door to your room part way and went cautiously to the kitchen. You wanted to know what Marya Vasilyevna and the mechanic were talking about. You walked quickly down the hallway but slowed your pace as you got nearer the kitchen. The mechanic was talking; it seemed he was speaking of something that happened to him at work.<br><br>You walked in. The mechanic stood talking with a towel in his hands and Marya Vasilyevna sat listening on a stool. Catching sight of you, the mechanic waved.<br><br><i>Hello, hello, Matveme Philipovich,</i> you said to him as you passed on your way to the bathroom. So far everything was calm. Marya Vasilyevna had gotten used to your peculiarities and might already have forgotten this most recent case.<br><br>Suddenly it occurred to you, you didn't lock the door. And what if the old woman crawls out of the room?|location=hallway
id=144|parent=142|type=user|text=Lock the door.|location=hallway
id=145|parent=144|type=auth|text=You rushed back, but caught yourself in time and, in order not to scare the tenants, you walked through the kitchen at an even pace.<br><br>Marya Vasilyevna was knocking on the kitchen table with her finger, saying to the mechanic,<br><br><i>Excewent! Now that's excewent! You would've whistwed too!</i><br><br>My heart froze as you walked out into the hallway and, now almost running, went off to your room.<br><br>Outside everything was calm. You walked up to the door and opened it just enough to look inside. The old woman was lying calmly as before with her face to the floor. The croquet mallet stood by the door where you'd left it. You took it, walked into the room and locked the door behind you. The room certainly smelled of a corpse. You stepped over the old woman, walked over to the window and sat down in the armchair. You hope this odor, still faint but already unbearable, doesn't make you sick. You lit your pipe. You felt nauseous and there was a slight pain in your stomach.|location=home
id=146|parent=144|type=user|text=Get the corpse out of the apartment.|location=home
id=147|parent=146|type=auth|text=What are you sitting here for? You need to act, quickly, before this old woman goes completely rancid. In any case, she must be stuffed into the suitcase with caution, because that's exactly the moment she could bite your finger. And then to die of an infection from a corpse? No thank you!<br><br><i>Aha!</i> you suddenly exclaimed. <i>I'm quite interested, what will you bite me with? Aren't those your little teeth way over there!</i>|location=home
id=148|parent=146|type=user|text=Look for her teeth.|location=home
id=149|parent=148|type=auth|text=You bent over in the armchair and looked into the corner on the far side of the window, where, by your calculations, the old woman's false teeth should have been. But the false teeth were not there.<br><br>You wondered, maybe the old woman was crawling around your room looking for her teeth? And maybe she even found them and put them back in her mouth?|location=home
id=150|parent=148|type=user|text=Check her mouth for the teeth.|location=home
id=151|parent=150|type=auth|text=You took the croquet mallet and used it to poke around in the corner. No, the dentures were gone. Then you took a heavy flannel sheet from a drawer and walked over to the old woman. You held the croquet mallet in your right hand at the ready, and in your left hand you held the flannel sheet.<br><br>The dead old woman aroused in you a mixture of squeamishness and fear. You lifted up her head with the mallet. Her mouth was open, her eyes rolled upwards, a large dark stain spread across the whole of her chin where you had kicked her with your boot. You looked into the old woman's mouth. No, she had not found her false teeth. You let go of her head. It dropped and banged against the floor.|location=home
id=152|parent=150|type=user|text=Wrap her in the sheet.|location=home
id=153|parent=152|type=auth|text=You spread the flannel sheet across the floor and pulled it right up to the old woman. Then with your foot and the croquet mallet you turned the old woman over to her left and onto her back. Now the old woman was lying on the sheet. The old woman's legs were bent at the knees and her fists pressed against her shoulders. It seemed that the old woman, lying on her back like a cat, was getting ready to defend herself against an eagle that was attacking her. Quickly, be gone with this carrion!|location=home
id=154|parent=152|type=user|text=Stuff her in the suitcase.|location=home
id=155|parent=154|type=auth|text=You wrapped the old woman in the thick sheet and lifted her into your arms. She turned out to be lighter than you thought. You let her down into the suitcase and tried closing the lid. Here you expected some difficulties, but the lid closed with relative ease. You snapped in the locks of the suitcase and straightened up.<br><br>The suitcase stood before you looking perfectly respectable as if inside it were books and linens. You took it by the handle and tried lifting it. It was, of course, heavy, but not too much so. You could no doubt carry it to the tram.|location=home
id=157|parent=154|type=user|text=Have a smoke.|location=home
id=158|parent=157|type=auth|text=You looked at your watch. Twenty past five. That's good. You sat down in the armchair to have a rest and finish smoking your pipe.<br><br>The sausages that you ate today were definitely not so good, because your stomach ached more and more. And maybe it was because you ate them raw? Yet again, maybe your stomach ache was purely your nerves.<br><br>You sit and smoke. And minute after minute goes by.<br><br>The spring sun shines in the window and you squint from its rays. Now it hides behind the chimney of the apartment house standing opposite, and the shadow cast by the chimney runs along the roof then flies across the street and falls across your face. You recall how yesterday at this exact time you sat writing your story. Here it is. The graph paper, and an inscription made in a fine hand, <i>The miracle worker was tall.</i><br><br>You looked out the window. A cripple walked down the street on a mechanical leg knocking loudly with his leg and his stick. Two workers and with them an old woman guffawed, holding their sides, at the cripple's funny gait.|location=home

I'll be paid the day after tomorrow. You wouldn't be able to lend you thirty rubles, would you?</i><br><br><i>I would,</i> said the mechanic. And you could hear his keys clanging as he unlocked some kind of box. Then he opened the door and stretched out a new thirty-ruble bill.<br><br><i>Many thanks, Matveme Philipovich,</i> you said.<br><br><i>It's nothing, it's nothing,</i> said the mechanic.|location=hallway

You got to the tram without a hitch, carrying the suitcase now in your right hand, now in your left.<br><br>You climbed into the tram from the front landing of the last car and started waving to the conductor so that she'd come over and receive payment for the luggage and the ticket. You didn't want to pass along your only thirty-ruble bill through the whole tram, and you couldn't bring yourself to leave the suitcase and go to the conductor yourself. The conductor came over to you at the landing and announced that she didn't have change. You were forced to get off at the very first stop.<br><br>You stood there stewing and waited for the next tram. Your stomach ached and your legs faintly quivered.<br><br>And suddenly you saw your sweet little lady. She was crossing the street, not looking in your direction.|location=street
id=167|parent=164|type=user|text=Chase after the girl.|location=street
id=169|parent=167|type=auth|text=You grabbed the suitcase and ran after her. You didn't know her name so you couldn't call out to her. The suitcase was a terrible hindrance. You held it in front of you with both hands, pushing it forward with your knees and stomach. The sweet little lady walked quite quickly and you had a feeling that you wouldn't be able to catch up to her. You were drenched with sweat and exhaustion. The sweet little lady turned into an alleyway. When you made it to the corner she was nowhere to be seen.<br><br><i>Damn old woman!</i> you hissed, throwing the suitcase on the ground.<br><br>The sleeves of your jacket were soaked through with sweat and clung to your arms. You sat down on the suitcase and, taking out a handkerchief, wiped your neck and face. Two boys stopped in front of you and began looking you over. You made a calm face and gazed intently at the nearest gateway as if you were waiting for someone. The boys whispered to each other and pointed their fingers at you. Wild malice choked you.

id=244|parent=244|type=auth|text=You climbed into the tram from the front landing of the last car and started waving to the conductor so that she'd come over and receive payment for the luggage and the ticket. You didn't want to pass along your only thirty-ruble bill through the whole tram, and you couldn't bring myself to leave the suitcase and go to the conductor yourself. The conductor came over to you at the landing and gave you your change for the thirty-ruble bill.<br><br>The train starts to move. What a pleasure it will be to dump this old woman in the swamp! Pity you forgot to take a stick with you as the old woman might need a push.<br><br>You pass Lanskaya and New Village. There's the golden top of the Buddhist pagoda, shining, and a glimpse of the sea.<br><br>The train slows its pace. You are approaching Lakhta. You sit still, trying not to seem suspicious.<i>Why won't it hurry up and move! Hurry up and move!</i><br><br>The train jerks to a start and you close your eyes in blissful pleasure. Oh, these minutes can be as sweet as moments of love! All your powers are in play.<br><br>The train stops again. It's Olgino. And again this torture!<br><br>A cold sweat emerges on your forehead and a slight chill flutters around your heart. The train is moving again and the rocking of the train car is very pleasant.<br><br>The train is approaching Foxes Nose. The white posts that border the road are flashing by. The train slows to a stop. The steps of your train car don't reach the ground.|location=train

id=246|parent=245|type=auth|text=You jump down from the tram and walk into the forest towards the swamp, carrying the suitcase. It feels light in your arms. As you walk, you begin picture how it will sink when you throw it in the swamp. You fantasize about the old woman disappearing forever. Your life will return to normal. Perhaps you can find that little lady from the bakery again.<br><br>After about twenty minutes of walking, you reach the edge of the swamp. |location=forest

It floats for a moment before tipping towards one corner and slowly sinking below the water. Air bubbles out of the sides of the case as it sinks. After about a minute, the case has vanished completely.<br><br>You stand for about ten minutes staring at the water where the suitcase disappeared. Eventually you begin to laugh. You laugh uncontrollably for a minute or so and then force yourself to stop, feeling a bit disgusted with yourself.<br><br>It's time to go home.|location=forest
id=249|parent=235|type=auth|text=The spring sun shines in the window and you squint from its rays.

All at once, you fall to the pavement, dropping the suitcase next to you.<br><br>You awake a few moments later, a crowd already assembling around you.

At first the people in the crowd are focused on you, but one notices the hair and screams.<br><br>The crowd panics, and in self defense, tears off your head.

You're talking about different things all the time, and you soon forget that in your room, on the floor, is a dead old woman. Your new acquaintance buys some raspberry jam to eat with the bread she bought for you, and you walk together back to her apartment, feeling better every moment.<br><br>A week goes by and you are still at her apartment. The old woman rotting into your floorboards couldn't be further from your mind. You ask the little lady to marry you. You can move to the countryside together and raise a family. She accepts. You don't bother returning home for your things. You don't care about them, and of course, there is the issue of the rancid corpse on the floor.<br><br>A few weeks later you hear that your old apartment super has been arrested. There is a rumor that he took advantage of your abandoned apartment and used it to kill an innocent old woman. You do not come forward with the truth. You move to the countryside and start a pig farm, and you never tell your wife why you were so eager to leave the city. Your life moves on and you try to forget.|location=sakerdon
