id=0|parent=ROOT|type=auth|text=Your name is Commodore Taylor. Until a few hours ago, you were the proud captain of the HMS Queenborough. Your ship now lies at the bottom of the sea, and you have been taken hostage by the pirates of the Calypso's Curse. You are the only one of your crew to be taken alive. You sit now in the pirate ship's brig, where you can hear raucous laughter from overhead.|location=brig

id=3|parent=2|type=auth|text=You sit down and have a good cry. Several minutes later, you hear a loud CRASH and the sound of wood splintering apart. The ship tilts wildly, throwing you against the wall. Your cell begins to fill with water, and eventually you drown.|location=drowned
id=4|parent=1|type=auth|text=You grab the bars and jostle them back in forth in anger. Nothing happens-- Wait, what was that? It sounded like a creaking noise. Is something loose? You glance over at the doorway to the brig. Nobody's standing guard, but they come to check in on you sporadically. If they find you trying to break free, they may decide you're more trouble than your ransom's worth.|location=brig

id=8|parent=6|type=auth|text=You kick the bars with all your strength. The creaking sound is louder this time. You can see now that the wooden beam supporting the hinges of your cage is splintered.|location=brig

id=12|parent=9|type=auth|text=You rear back and give an almighty kick. There's a loud creaking sound as the hinges tear from the beam, and the heavy metal door hits the ground with a booming CLANG. For a moment, you fear that somebody may have heard you-- but this fear is quickly replaced by another as an enormous CRASH makes the whole ship shudder. Water begins to leak into the brig at an alarming pace; the ship is sinking.|location=brig
id=13|parent=9|type=user|text=Get out of there!|location=brig
id=14|parent=13|type=auth|text=You scramble over the fallen cell door and up the ladder. Finally above deck, you blink in the sudden light. Thankfully, the crew is in such a mad scramble that they don't even seem to notice you. Now what?|location=deck

id=20|parent=17|type=auth|text=You hop the ship's railing and leap into the water. Thank god you bothered to learn how to swim. You never did learn how to dive, however, and the water hits you with a painful SLAP. Combined with the freezing cold, you nearly pass out. Just barely clinging to consciousness, you paddle away from the sinking ship and narrowly avoid being pulled beneath it.|location=ocean

id=25|parent=22|type=auth|text=You go east, hoping to spot land. Unfortunately, the sharks get to you first.|location=drowned
id=26|parent=23|type=auth|text=You go north, hoping to spot land. After what feels like forever, you spy a small blip on the horizon. Spurned on by hope, you push forward... and eventually make it to the beach. For a few minutes, you simply lie in the sand and let the waves wash over you. Everything hurts, your hair is stiff with sea salt, and you've got no supplies. But at least you're alive. SUCCESS!|location=beach
