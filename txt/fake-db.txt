id=11|parent=10|type=auth|text=You walk on without looking around. You go out onto the street and walk on the sunny side. The spring sun is very pleasant.

id=22|parent=20|type=user|text=Torture them with tetanus.|location=home
id=23|parent=22|type=auth|text=Most of all you like the idea of afflicting them with tetanus so that they'd suddenly stop moving. Their parents drag them back to their respective homes. They lie in their little beds and can't even eat, because their mouths don't open. They are nourished artificially. After a week the tetanus goes away, but the children are so weak that they still have to be confined to their beds for a whole month more. Then, bit by bit, they begin to recover.|location=home

id=25|parent=24|type=auth|text=You afflict them with a second bout of tetanus and they all expire.<br><br>You lie on the sofa with your eyes open and can't fall asleep. You recall the old woman with the clock that you saw today in the yard, and it pleases you that her clock had no hands. Just the other day at the pawn shop you saw the most hideous kitchen clock and the hands were made in the form of a knife and a fork.<br><br>My God! but you haven't yet turned off the electric stove! You jump up and turn it off, then lie down again on the sofa and try to fall asleep. You close my eyes. You're not sleepy. In the window the spring sun shines right down on you. You get hot. You get up and sit down in the armchair by the window.|location=home

id=29|parent=28|type=auth|text=Now you're sleepy, but you will not sleep. You will take paper and pen and you will write. You sense an awful strength within you. You thought everything over yesterday already. It will be a story about a miracle worker who lives in your time and does not work miracles. He knows he is a miracle worker and could create any sort of miracle, but he does not do it. He is evicted from his apartment%E2%80%94he knows that were he to just wave a finger the apartment would stay his, but he does not do it; he timidly vacates his apartment and lives outside of town in a shed.

id=30|parent=28|type=user|text=Write it now!|location=home
id=31|parent=30|type=auth|text=You sit and wring my hands with joy. Sakerdon Mikhailovich will explode with envy. He thinks that you're no longer capable of writing a thing of genius.

id=33|parent=30|type=user|text=Don't you need your supplies?|location=home
id=34|parent=33|type=auth|text=You shiver all over with anticipation. You can't figure out what you should do: you needed to take pen and paper, but you grabbed various objects, not at all the ones that you needed. You ran about the room from the window to the desk, from the desk to the stove, from the stove to the desk again, and then to the couch and again to the window. You couldnt breathe from the fire that raged in your chest. It's only five o'clock yet. The whole day is ahead, and the evening, and all of the night.|location=home
id=35|parent=33|type=user|text=Never mind the supplies, just get started.|location=home
id=36|parent=35|type=auth|text=You stand in the middle of the room. What am you thinking? It's already twenty past five. You have to write. You push the little table up to the window and sit down at it. In front of you is the graph paper; in your hand, the pen.<br><br>Your heart is still pounding too hard and your hand shakes. You wait to settle down. You put down the pen and fill your pipe. The sun is shining right in your eyes; you squint and light your pipe.<br><br>Now a crow flies past the window. You look out the window and see a man on the sidewalk with a mechanical leg. He’s knocking loudly with his leg and his cane.<br><br><i>So…</i> you say to yourself as you continue looking out the window.<br><br>The sun hides behind the chimney of the apartment house standing opposite. The shadow cast by the chimney runs along the roof then flies across the street and falls across your face. You ought to take advantage of this shadow and write a few words about the miracle worker. You grab the pen and write: <i>The miracle worker was tall.</i>|location=home
id=38|parent=35|type=user|text=Give up.|location=home
id=39|parent=38|type=auth|text=You can't write anything more. You sit until the moment you start experiencing hunger.

id=40|parent=38|type=user|text=Ignore it.|location=home
id=41|parent=39|type=auth|text=<i>Who is it?</i><br><br>No one answers you. You open the door and before you you see the old woman who this morning was standing in the courtyard with the clock. You're very surprised and can't say a thing.<br><br><i>And here you are,</i> says the old woman and walks into your room.<br><br>You stand at the door and don’t know what to do—boot her out or, on the contrary, offer her a seat? But the old woman walks over to your armchair by the window and sits down herself.<br><br><i>Close the door, and lock it,</i> the old woman tells you.|location=home

id=45|parent=43|type=auth|text=And you get down on your knees.<br><br>But here you begin to understand the complete awkwardness of your situation. Why are you standing on your knees before some old woman? And why is this old woman in your room sitting in your favorite chair? Why did you not throw this old woman out?|location=home
id=46|parent=43|type=user|text=Tell her off!|location=home
id=47|parent=43|type=user|text=Too late now...|location=home
id=48|parent=46|type=auth|text=<i>Listen up,</i> you say, <i>what right do you have giving orders in my room, and moreover ordering me around?

id=49|parent=46|type=user|text=Do it.|location=home
id=50|parent=46|type=user|text=No!|location=home
id=51|parent=49|type=auth|text=You instantly fulfill her command.<br><br>Directly in front of you you see precisely drafted squares. Pain in your shoulder and in your right hip forces you to change your position. You was lying face down; now with great difficulty you get up onto your knees. All your members had fallen asleep; they bend poorly. You look around and see yourself in your room standing on your knees in the middle of the floor. Consciousness and memory slowly come back to you. You look around the room again and see that on the chair by the window someone is sitting. It's not very light in the room, probably because it's white nights. Your gaze is fixed. Oh God! Can it really be the old woman sitting in your armchair still? You crane your neck and look. Yes, of course, it's the old woman, and she's dropped her head onto her chest. She must have fallen asleep. You get up and, limping, approach her. The old woman's head droops on her chest, her arms hang by the sides of the chair. You want to grab this old woman and push her out the door.|location=home
id=52|parent=49|type=user|text=Tell her to leave.|location=home
id=53|parent=49|type=user|text=Let her sleep.|location=home
id=54|parent=52|type=auth|text=<i>Listen to me,</i> you say, <i>You are in my room. I need to work. I'm asking you to leave.</i><br><br>The old woman doesn't budge. You bend down and peer into the old woman's face. Her mouth is slightly open and jutting out of her mouth are the false teeth that must have come loose. And suddenly everything becomes clear to you: The old woman is dead.<br><br>A terrible feeling of irritation overtakes you. What for did the old woman die in your room? You can't stand dead people. And now fuss over this carrion, go talk to the janitor and the building super and explain to them why this old woman turned up at your place. You look at the old woman with loathing. But what if, maybe, she's not dead? You feel her forehead. It's cold. Her hand also. Well, what are you to do?|location=home
id=55|parent=52|type=user|text=Go talk to the janitor.|location=home
id=56|parent=52|type=user|text=Have a smoke.|location=home
id=57|parent=56|type=auth|text=You light up your pipe and sit down on the sofa. A mad anger swells up inside you.<br><br><i>What a scumbag!</i> you say out loud.<br><br>The dead old woman sits like a sack in your armchair. The teeth jut out of her mouth. She resembles a dead horse.|location=home
id=58|parent=56|type=user|text=Cover her with a newspaper.|location=home
id=59|parent=56|type=user|text=Leave her.|location=home
id=60|parent=59|type=auth|text=<i>A disgusting scene,</i> you say, but you can't cover the old woman with a newspaper because who knows what might happen under a newspaper.<br><br>Behind the wall you can hear movement: That's your neighbor getting up, a train engine driver. That's just what you need, for him to sniff out that you've got a dead old woman sitting in your room! You listen closely to the steps of your neighbor. What's taking him so long? It's already half past five! It's long time for him to be going. Oh your God! He's fixing to have tea! You can hear the primus stove making noise behind the wall. Ack, if that cursed engine driver would just hurry up and leave!<br><br>You pull your legs up onto the sofa and lie there. Eight minutes go by, but the neighbor's tea still isn't ready and the primus stove is hissing.|location=home
id=61|parent=59|type=user|text=Sneak out of your apartment.|location=home
id=62|parent=59|type=user|text=Take a nap.|location=home
id=63|parent=62|type=auth|text=You close your eyes and nap.<br><br>You dream that your neighbor has gone and you go out, at the same time as he, onto the landing and slam the door with the spring lock behind you. You don't have a key and you can't get back into the apartment. You have to buzz and wake the rest of the tenants, and that's real bad. You stand on the landing thinking what you should do, and suddenly you notice that you have no hands. You tilt your head to get a better look if you have hands or not, and you see that on one side instead of a hand a table knife juts out, and on the other side, a fork.<br><br><i>There now,</i> you say to Sakerdon Mikhailovich, who's sitting for some reason right nearby on a folding chair. <i>You see,</i> you say to him, <i>what kind of hands I've got.</i><br><br>But Sakerdon Mikhailovich sits silently, and you realize that it's not the real Sakerdon Mikhailovich, but a clay one.<br><br>Then you wake up and it dawns on you that you're lying in your room on the sofa and that at the window in the armchair is the dead old woman.<br><br>You quickly turn your head towards her. The old woman is not in the armchair. You gaze at the empty armchair and you are filled with wild joy. That means it was all a dream. Only, where did it begin? Did the old woman come into your room yesterday evening? Perhaps that was also a dream? You came back home yesterday because I'd forgotten to turn off the electric stove. But maybe that was also a dream? Either way, how great is it that there is no dead old woman in your room and you don't have to go to the building super and fuss with the corpse!<br><br>But wait, how long have you been asleep? You looked at the clock. Half past nine, must be morning.<br><br>God! What doesn't happen in dreams!|location=home
id=63|parent=62|type=user|text=Might as well get up anyway.|location=home
id=64|parent=62|type=user|text=I've had enough for today. Go back to sleep.|location=home
id=65|parent=63|type=auth|text=You dropped your feet down off the sofa about to stand up, when suddenly you saw the dead old woman lying on the floor behind the table by the chair. She was lying there face up and the dentures that had fallen out of her mouth bit into her nostril with one tooth. The arms were turned under the torso and were not visible, and bony legs in white, dirty wool stockings stuck out from under her hiked-up skirt.|location=home
id=68|parent=63|type=|text=Go talk to the super.|location=home
id=66|parent=63|type=user|text=Kick her.|location=home
id=67|parent=66|type=auth|text=<i>Scumbag!</i> you yelled and, running up to the old woman, kicked her in the chin with your boot.<br><br>Her dentures flew off into the corner. You wanted to hit the old woman a second time, but hesitated to leave marks on the body, or else they'd later decide that it was you who killed her.<br><br>You backed away from the old woman, sat down on the sofa and lit up your pipe. About twenty minutes passed like that. Now it was clear to you that no matter what, the case would be transferred to criminal investigation and the pea brain detective would charge you with murder. The situation was turning out to be serious, and then there was the boot to the chin on top of it all.<br><br>You walked up to the old woman again, bent down and started examining her face. There was a small dark spot on the chin. No, they couldn't raise a stink about that. So what? Maybe the old woman banged herself on something or other while she was still alive? You calm down a little and start to pace the room, smoking your pipe and mulling over your situation.<br><br>You're walking around and around the room, and you start feeling your hunger more and more. You even start shivering from hunger. Again you fumble around in the little cupboard where your provisions are kept, but find nothing except for the piece of sugar.|location=home
id=69|parent=66|type=user|text=Go buy some food.|location=home
id=70|parent=66|type=user|text=Stay home and focus!|location=home
id=71|parent=69|type=auth|text=You take out your wallet and count the money. Eleven rubles. That means you can buy myself some ham and bread and there'll still be some left over for tobacco.<br><br>You straighten your tie which had gotten beaten out of shape over the course of the night. You take your watch, put on your jacket, walk out into the hall, thoroughly lock the door to your room, put the key in your pocket and walk outside. First you must eat, then your thoughts will be clearer and you will undertake some kind of action with this carrion.<br><br>On the way to the store you get this idea: Why not drop in on Sakerdon Mikhailovich and tell him everything, maybe together we can come up with something sooner. But right away you reject this idea because some things must be done alone, without witnesses.<br><br>There was no ham at the store so you bought myself half a kilogram of sausage links. There was no tobacco either. From the store you went straight to the bakery.<br><br>At the bakery there was a big crowd and a long line formed for the cashier. You made a face but got in line anyway. The line moved very slowly and then stopped completely because some sort of scene had occurred at the cash register.<br><br>You made a face as though you knew nothing about it and gazed into the back of a young little lady who was standing in line ahead of you. The young little lady was obviously very curious: She craned her little neck right and left and once a minute she would get up on her tippy-toes to get a better look at what was going on at the register. Finally she turned to you and asked,<br><br><i>Do you know what's going on over there?</i>|location=home
